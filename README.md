# Curration of Fermentation dataset 
The main items in the repository are:
* data/dataset.csv - the updated and curated metadata table 
* data_wrangling.ipynb - the notebook used to clean and update the metadata.
* Files used for the curation of the table and intermediate files are located in data/data_sources. 

Parts of the data curation were done manually. This is reflected in notes within the data wrangling notebook. 

## Food taxonomy
Another part of the work was to reorganize the food taxonomy columns. **This was primarily done manually** <br>
The notebook was used to splice the data and reduce the rows to only the unique vlaues. <br>
On top of the current column reorganization, we added additional information columns depicting the main fermentation outputs as well as some of the fermentation conditions. <br>
Notes on the manual work are available in data/Food taxonomy notes.md.
