# Curration of Fermentation dataset 
The main items in the repository are:
* data/dataset.csv - the updated and curated metadata table 
* data_wrangling.ipynb - the notebook used to clean and update the metadata.
* Files used for the curation of the table and intermediate files are located in data/data_sources. 

Parts of the data curation were done manually. This is reflected in notes within the data wrangling notebook. 

## food taxonomy
Another part of the work was to reorganize the food taxonomy columns. **This was primarily done manually** <br>
